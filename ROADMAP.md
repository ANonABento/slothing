## Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Duration | Key Milestone |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Phase 1 | 2-3 weeks | Multi-user production-ready |
| Phase 2 | 3-4 weeks | Google Workspace integration |
| Phase 3 | 2-3 weeks | Other integrations (LinkedIn, Email) |
| Phase 4 | 2-3 weeks | Enhanced feature set |
| Phase 5 | 2-4 weeks | Polished, scalable product |

**Total: 11-17 weeks** for full production readiness

---

## Quick Wins Remaining

These don't depend on other phases:

1. **Video recording** - Extend audio recording to video
2. **External salary data** - Integrate real market data
3. **Performance audit** - Optimize for Core Web Vitals
4. **E2E test coverage** - Add Playwright tests for critical flows

---

## Tech Stack (Implemented)

| Layer | Technology | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| **Auth** | NextAuth | ✅ Installed |
| **Database** | libSQL/Turso + Drizzle | ✅ Schema ready |
| **Google APIs** | googleapis npm | Planned |
| **Email** | Resend | Planned |
| **Hosting** | Vercel | Planned |
| **Monitoring** | Sentry | Planned |
| **Analytics** | PostHog | Planned |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create Turso Account** - Set up a hosted libSQL database at https://turso.tech
2. **Add TURSO_DATABASE_URL** - Configure connection string in `.env.local`
3. **Run Migrations** - Execute `npm run db:push` to create tables
4. **Test Auth Flow** - Sign up, sign in, verify data isolation
5. **Deploy to Vercel** - Connect repo and deploy

---

## Notes

- Prioritize **Phase 1** before any public launch
- **LinkedIn integration** is complex due to API restrictions
- **NextAuth** is installed and configured - handles auth flows
- **Drizzle schema** is ready - just needs Turso database connection
- **Job board APIs** may require partnerships or scraping (legal gray area)
- Keep local libSQL for local dev and Turso for production
- Documentation is complete in `docs/` directory
