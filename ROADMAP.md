# Slothing Roadmap

> AI-powered job application assistant - from MVP to production

---

## Current State: Product MVP+ Complete

Slothing is a feature-complete job-search workspace for local/self-hosted use, with production-facing infrastructure partially implemented and a few public-launch gaps still visible.

**Core product:**

- Resume parsing, component bank, Studio editing, manual tailoring, AI tailoring, PDF/DOCX/LaTeX/plain-text export, and 7-day share links.
- Opportunity tracking with review queue, status pipeline, company research, calendar/reminder surfaces, analytics, and dashboard summaries.
- ATS scanner, cover-letter generation, email templates, interview prep with text/voice/audio recording, and salary tools.
- Multi-provider LLM support through OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and OpenRouter.

**Extension and agent surfaces:**

- Browser extension for Chrome/Firefox builds, form autofill, answer-bank capture/search, job-page sidebar, inline AI assistant, badge notifications, multistep Workday/Greenhouse support, and bulk Greenhouse/Lever/Workday scraping.
- Job scrapers for LinkedIn, Indeed, Greenhouse, Lever, Waterloo Works, Workday list pages, and generic JSON-LD job postings.
- `@slothing/mcp` v1 shipped as a local MCP server with profile, opportunity, opportunity-detail, answer-bank search, and save-answer tools.

**Integrations:**

- Google OAuth/token refresh code exists and gates Settings UI when auth is not configured.
- Google Calendar, Drive, Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Contacts API routes/components exist, but remain environment- and account-setup gated.
- Daily digest, Gmail status detection, Google calendar sync, cleanup, email retry, follow-up, and reminder crons are implemented; weekly digest is intentionally disabled until a distinct weekly email exists.

## Open Gaps From Audit

These are the current visible placeholders, planned-but-unshipped specs, or stale roadmap items that still need product decisions.

| Area                         | Status          | Gap                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Extension store launch       | Setup-gated     | Store CTAs are hidden until at least one live marketplace URL is configured; Safari support is still planned.                                                       |
| Google setup UX              | Setup-gated     | Google integration works only when NextAuth/Google OAuth are configured; disabled states now explain the required OAuth/NextAuth setup.                             |
| Toolkit tabs                 | Cleaned up      | `/toolkit?tab=cover-letter` redirects into Studio cover-letter mode; Recruiter Rewriter is hidden until the workflow ships.                                         |
| Studio tailor settings       | Wired           | ATS strictness now shapes AI prompt guidance and deterministic manual/fallback formatting.                                                                          |
| Dashboard interview rail     | Cleaned up      | The interview rail shows real opportunity status instead of placeholder timing.                                                                                     |
| Advanced onboarding          | Added           | Advanced steps now point to cover letters, interview prep, salary research, Studio templates, and calendar surfaces.                                                |
| Cron jobs                    | Operationalized | Configured cron routes now do real work; weekly digest is disabled and removed from the deployed schedule until a distinct weekly email ships.                      |
| Custom template uploads      | Shipped         | HTML/Markdown/DOCX/PDF template import, Studio picker integration, metadata editing, delete, and fallback behavior are wired.                                       |
| Component preview follow-ups | Partial         | Drive DOCX import and durable TXT/DOCX text previews are wired; preview editing, multi-page drag-select, and image-only PDF OCR remain follow-ups.                  |
| MCP v2 write tools           | Shipped         | Agent-facing push-job, update-status, and scrape-url tools are exposed through `@slothing/mcp` over extension-token routes.                                         |
| Pricing waitlist             | Implemented     | Pricing now includes a real waitlist form backed by `/api/waitlist` and persisted waitlist entries.                                                                 |
| Production platform          | Partial         | Turso production DB setup and hosted migration execution remain account-bound; migration, backup/restore, and deployment runbooks are documented.                  |
| Vocabulary re-skin           | Deferred spec   | UX audit found internal jargon (Components/Bank/Knowledge/JD/Unverified draft) is the #1 new-user barrier. Proposed label mapping parked in `docs/specs/vocabulary-reskin.md` pending wording sign-off. |
| New-user seed data (B3)      | Open decision   | Fresh accounts show 718 sample jobs, "99+" notifications, and pre-checked onboarding — alarms new users. Decide: start empty vs label "Sample"; unify Opportunities + Review Queue. |
| Landing demo videos (A7)     | Open decision   | Landing references 7 `/marketing/sections/*.mp4` that exist nowhere in the repo (404s); only `.png` posters ship. Decide: add the videos or go poster-only. |

See `docs/ui-audit/ux-audit-2026-06-07.md` for the full 38-finding UX/UI audit.

## Next Phase Plan: Launch Readiness

### P0 - Remove Public Placeholders

**Goal:** No user-facing "coming soon" affordance should appear on a primary route unless it is behind an intentional launch gate.

- [x] Publish or hide extension store CTAs until at least one listing is live.
- [x] Replace `/toolkit?tab=cover-letter` placeholder with a redirect/deep link into Studio's cover-letter workflow.
- [x] Ship Recruiter Rewriter or remove the tab until the workflow is ready.
- [x] Replace dashboard interview `coming soon` copy with real interview date/status data or hide the line.
- [x] Wire ATS strictness into manual/AI tailor generation, or remove the control from the dialog.
- [x] Add advanced onboarding steps using already-shipped product surfaces.

### P1 - Operationalize Background Work

**Goal:** Every configured cron route should do real work or be removed from deployment config.

- [x] Implement cleanup cron for expired shares, stale sessions, and old transient records.
- [x] Implement weekly digest or remove the route until a weekly product email exists.
- [x] Implement email retry cron for failed Gmail/app email sends, or collapse it into the existing send flow.
- [x] Add cron run logging and a small admin/status view.

### P2 - Public Launch Conversion

**Goal:** Make the public site and hosted app credible before store launch.

- [x] Replace pricing email CTA with a waitlist form and `/api/waitlist`.
- [x] Add extension launch-state feature flag for marketing/onboarding.
- [x] Verify Google disabled states explain setup rather than implying missing implementation.
- [x] Add production-safe user data deletion flow.
- [x] Add Sentry or equivalent error monitoring.
- [x] Add lightweight product analytics for activation funnels.

### P3 - Template And Preview Follow-Through

**Goal:** Finish the planned document-management workflows after launch blockers are closed.

- [x] Implement custom template upload/import for HTML, Markdown, and DOCX.
- [x] Add custom template management: rename, delete, and fallback behavior.
- [x] Add rich custom template metadata editing.
- [x] Add Drive/plain-text imports to component preview.
- [x] Add durable text preview storage for non-PDF parsed previews.
- [x] Explore OCR for image-only PDFs after extractable-PDF paths are stable.

### P4 - Agent Write Surface

**Goal:** Promote proven REST workflows into discoverable MCP tools.

- [x] Add `slothing_push_job`.
- [x] Add `slothing_update_status`.
- [x] Add `slothing_scrape_url`.
- [x] Keep MCP v2 as a thin adapter over extension-token routes.

## Later Bets

These are valuable, but should wait until launch placeholders and production foundations are clean.

- Video interview recording and AI analysis of recorded responses.
- External salary data from Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, or other providers.
- LinkedIn OAuth/profile import, subject to API and policy constraints.
- Networking CRM: contact database, referral tracking, event tracking, and LinkedIn notes.
- Mobile app.
- MCP package publication after v1/v2 tool surface is validated.

## Notes

- Treat old "Not Started" Google roadmap docs as historical unless they contradict the code; the current blocker is setup, polish, and launch gating.
- Keep local libSQL for local dev and Turso/libSQL for production.
- Job board APIs may require partnerships or scraping policy review; extension-owned scraping is already implemented for the primary targets.
- Prioritize removing visible placeholders before adding new feature surfaces.
