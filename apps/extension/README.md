# Columbus Browser Extension

Browser extension for Slothing that auto-fills job applications and imports job listings from major job sites.

Columbus is the browser-extension sub-brand within the Slothing product; user-facing extension chrome keeps the Columbus name while imported opportunities land in Slothing.

## Prerequisites

- Columbus main app running locally (`npm run dev` in parent directory)
- Node.js 18+
- Chrome or Firefox browser

## Setup

```bash
cd columbus-extension
npm install
npm run build          # Chrome    → dist/
npm run build:firefox  # Firefox   → dist-firefox/
```

The build pipeline pulls icons from `icons/source/columbus.svg` (a branded compass design), renders them at 16/32/48/128 via `sharp`, and copies them into `src/assets/icons/`, `dist/icons/`, and `dist-firefox/icons/` automatically. All four PNGs stay under 4KB.

### Load in Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `columbus-extension/dist/` directory
5. Pin the Columbus icon in the toolbar

### Load in Firefox

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on...**
3. Select `columbus-extension/dist-firefox/manifest.json`

### Quick demo (no real job site needed)

A self-contained demo launcher boots a fresh Chromium, loads the unpacked extension, and opens a sample job application form with embedded `JobPosting` JSON-LD:

```bash
node demo/launch-with-extension.mjs
```

This launches a clean Chromium profile (`demo/.user-data-dir/`) so you can try auto-fill, the badge notification, and the scraper against a known-good fixture without leaving the extension's directory. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to close.

The demo form has 18 form fields (name / contact / address / URLs / current role / years of experience), 4 free-text custom questions, a visa-status select, and a date picker — covers all the major field-detector patterns.

## Usage Guide

### 1. Connect to Columbus

The extension needs to authenticate with your Columbus account:

1. Start the Columbus app (`npm run dev` in the parent directory)
2. Click the Columbus extension icon in your toolbar
3. Click **Connect Account**
4. A new tab opens at `/extension/connect` - sign in with Clerk
5. Token is generated and stored automatically
6. The popup now shows your profile info

### 2. Auto-Fill Job Applications

Navigate to any job application form (e.g., on Greenhouse, Lever, LinkedIn):

- **Keyboard shortcut**: `Cmd+Shift+F` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+F` (Windows)
- **Via popup**: Click Columbus icon, then **Fill Form**

The extension detects form fields using multiple signals (name, id, label, placeholder, autocomplete attributes) and maps them to your Columbus profile data.

**Supported field types** (35+): name, email, phone, address, city, state, zip, country, LinkedIn URL, GitHub URL, website, current company, current title, education details, years of experience, work authorization, and more.

### 3. Import Job Listings

When you're on a supported job site:

- **Keyboard shortcut**: `Cmd+Shift+I` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows)
- **Via popup**: Click Columbus icon, then **Import Job**

The job title, company, location, description, requirements, salary, and keywords are scraped and saved to your Columbus tracker.

### 4. Learning System

When you answer custom questions on job applications:

1. The extension detects the question and your typed answer
2. After you move focus away, a prompt asks if you want to save it
3. On future applications with similar questions, your saved answer is suggested
4. Manage saved answers in **Settings** (right-click extension icon > Options)

### 5. Toolbar badge (job-detected indicator)

When the content script's scraper successfully detects a job listing on the current page, the extension's toolbar icon shows a `!` badge (blue `#3b82f6`) with the hover title `Job detected — press Cmd+Shift+I to import`. The badge clears automatically when the tab navigates to a new URL.

The behavior is controlled by the `notifyOnJobDetected` setting (default: enabled). Toggle it from the options page if you find it noisy.

Implementation: content script sends a `JOB_DETECTED` message to the background once per page after the first successful scrape; the background calls `chrome.action.setBadgeText/Color/Title` and tracks per-tab state. Reset on `chrome.tabs.onUpdated` when the URL changes. SPA navigation (URL changes without a full reload) is handled by re-arming the notify-once flag.

### 6. Settings

Right-click the Columbus icon > **Options** to configure:

- **Connection**: API URL (default `http://localhost:3000`)
- **Auto-Fill**: Toggle on/off, confidence threshold (0-100%)
- **Learning**: Toggle learning from answers
- **Notifications**: Badge when job detected (`notifyOnJobDetected`)
- **Saved Answers**: View and delete learned answers

## Architecture

### Extension Components

```
popup (React)  ──message──>  background (service worker)  ──HTTP──>  Columbus API
                                    ^
content script  ──message──────────┘
(auto-fill, scrapers, learning)
```

- **Background** (`src/background/`): Service worker handling auth, API calls, message routing
- **Content Script** (`src/content/`): Injected into pages for form detection, scraping, learning
- **Popup** (`src/popup/`): React UI for the toolbar popup
- **Options** (`src/options/`): React settings page

### API Endpoints (Main App)

All extension endpoints use token auth via `X-Extension-Token` header:

| Endpoint                                | Method | Purpose                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/api/extension/auth`                   | POST   | Generate token (uses Clerk session)                          |
| `/api/extension/auth`                   | DELETE | Revoke token(s)                                              |
| `/api/extension/auth/verify`            | GET    | Validate token                                               |
| `/api/extension/profile`                | GET    | Fetch profile with computed fields                           |
| `/api/opportunities/from-extension`     | POST   | Import single or batch scraped jobs as pending opportunities |
| `/api/extension/learned-answers`        | GET    | List saved answers                                           |
| `/api/extension/learned-answers`        | POST   | Save new answer                                              |
| `/api/extension/learned-answers/search` | POST   | Similarity search                                            |
| `/api/extension/learned-answers/[id]`   | PATCH  | Update answer                                                |
| `/api/extension/learned-answers/[id]`   | DELETE | Delete answer                                                |

#### Opportunity Import Contract

`POST /api/opportunities/from-extension` accepts a single scraped job object or a batch shape:

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "title": "Frontend Engineer",
      "company": "Acme",
      "location": "Remote",
      "description": "Full job description...",
      "requirements": ["React", "TypeScript"],
      "responsibilities": ["Build product UI"],
      "keywords": ["React"],
      "type": "full-time",
      "remote": true,
      "salary": "$120k-$150k",
      "url": "https://example.com/jobs/frontend",
      "source": "linkedin",
      "sourceJobId": "abc-123",
      "postedAt": "2026-04-29",
      "deadline": "2026-05-15"
    }
  ]
}
```

The app creates each imported job with `status: "pending"`, adds an unread notification for the user, and returns:

```json
{
  "imported": 1,
  "opportunityIds": ["job-123"],
  "pendingCount": 3
}
```

### Authentication Flow

1. User clicks "Connect" in popup
2. Background opens `/extension/connect` in new tab
3. Connect page authenticates via Clerk, calls `POST /api/extension/auth`
4. Token stored in `localStorage` for extension pickup
5. Extension stores token in `chrome.storage.local`
6. All subsequent API calls include `X-Extension-Token` header
7. Token valid for 30 days

## Development

### Commands

```bash
npm run dev           # Watch mode (Chrome)
npm run build         # Production build (Chrome -> dist/)
npm run build:firefox # Production build (Firefox -> dist-firefox/)
npm run type-check    # TypeScript validation (strict: false)
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run test          # Vitest
npm run generate-icons # Regenerate placeholder icons
```

### Adding a New Scraper

1. Create `src/content/scrapers/my-scraper.ts` extending `BaseScraper`
2. Implement `canHandle()`, `scrapeJobListing()`, `scrapeJobList()`
3. Register in `src/content/scrapers/scraper-registry.ts`

## Testing

### Automated tests

Unit tests (vitest):

```bash
npm test                # watch mode
npm run test:run        # single run
```

Currently covers `src/background/badge.ts` (badge notification module).

End-to-end tests (Playwright + persistent Chromium with extension loaded):

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Coverage includes:

- Extension service worker registers (valid 32-char extension ID)
- Popup renders the Columbus heading + Connect Account button (unauthenticated state)
- Options page renders Settings heading + URL input + Save button
- Content script injects on a fixture page without uncaught errors
- LinkedInScraper extracts title / company / location / description from a static fixture (`tests/fixtures/linkedin-mock.html`)
- LinkedIn job-list selectors match two cards in the fixture
- Greenhouse, Lever, Indeed, and Workday fixture scrape coverage with from-extension payload validation
- Autofill coverage against `demo/job-form.html`, including sensitive/custom field non-fill assertions and idempotency
- Env-gated Slothing integration coverage for extension scrape/import into `/api/opportunities/from-extension`

Additional fixture snapshots live under `tests/fixtures/`:

- `greenhouse-mock.html`
- `lever-mock.html`
- `indeed-mock.html`
- `workday-mock.html`

The Slothing integration spec is skipped by default. Run it explicitly with:

```bash
SLOTHING_INTEGRATION=1 npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/slothing-integration.spec.ts
```

CI workflow at `.github/workflows/extension-e2e.yml` runs the e2e suite on every push that touches `columbus-extension/`.

#### Sites to Test

| Site           | Test URL Pattern                        | What to Verify                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| LinkedIn       | `/jobs/view/12345`                      | Title, company, location, description extracted |
| Indeed         | `/viewjob?jk=abc`                       | Salary info, job type detected                  |

| Waterloo Works | `waterlooworks.uwaterloo.ca`            | Requires SSO auth first                         |
| Generic        | Any site with `JobPosting` JSON-LD      | Fallback scraper works                          |

### Debugging

Open DevTools on any page:

- **Console**: Filter by `[Columbus]` to see extension logs
- **Network**: Filter by `/api/extension/` to see API calls
- **Application > Storage > Extension Storage**: View stored auth/settings
- **Background page**: `chrome://extensions` > Columbus > "service worker" link

## Known Limitations

- **No conflict detection**: Auto-fill overwrites existing field values
- **No retry logic**: API failures are not automatically retried
- **Token delivery**: Connect page uses localStorage fallback (no `externally_connectable` in manifest yet)
- **Waterloo Works**: Only works when logged into university SSO
- **Bundle size**: popup.js and options.js are ~400KB (React not tree-shaken; could swap to Preact)
- **Workday**: Dedicated Workday scraper is still missing; current coverage pins the GenericScraper JSON-LD fallback.
