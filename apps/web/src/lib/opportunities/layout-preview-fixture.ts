/**
 * Static sample opportunity used by the layout builder's live preview.
 * Spec: docs/opportunity-card-layout-builder-spec.md §4.
 *
 * Every chunk has data to render — no conditional null returns — so the
 * builder shows the user exactly what each chunk looks like, even ones
 * the user wouldn't normally see (e.g. `applicant-ratio` is rare on
 * real WW postings).
