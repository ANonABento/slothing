            Slothing stores the profile, resume, job tracking, reminder, and
            interview preparation data you add to the product. If you connect
            Google services, the app also stores the minimum tokens and metadata
            needed to sync with those tools. We may also collect account
            identifiers, email address, usage events, device and log
            information, and files or text you upload for parsing, generation,
            export, or troubleshooting.

            How we use it
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Your data is used to power application tracking, document parsing,
            analytics, calendar exports, reminders, and AI-assisted features you
            explicitly trigger. We do not sell your personal job search data. We
            may also use limited operational data to secure the service, prevent
            abuse, debug errors, improve product quality, and communicate
            important account or service updates.

            Data sharing
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Third-party providers are only involved when you use integrations or
            AI features, such as Google for sign-in and connected workflows,
            hosting and infrastructure providers, analytics and email tooling,
            or an LLM provider you configure in the app. These providers may
            process data on our behalf under their own security and privacy
            commitments. We may disclose information if required by law, to
            protect rights and safety, or as part of a corporate transaction.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>Google sign-in scopes.</strong> When you sign in with
            Google, Slothing currently requests the following scopes together so
            connected workflows are ready when you need them: basic account
            profile and email, Google Calendar, Drive (files created by the
            app), Gmail read and send, and read-only Contacts. You will be shown
            these scopes by Google before you grant access, and you can revoke
            them at any time from your Google Account permissions page. Slothing
            only calls these APIs in response to features you trigger, and does
            not background-scan your inbox or files outside of features you
            explicitly use.

          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>Browser extension.</strong> The Columbus browser extension
            requests only the permissions needed to read job pages you visit on
            supported job sites and to keep your connection token in extension
            storage. It does not request Gmail, Calendar, Drive, or Contacts
            permissions — those workflows run in the Slothing web app under your
            Google sign-in instead.

            Retention and deletion
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            You control the content you add. Deleting jobs, reminders,
            documents, or generated resumes removes them from the app&apos;s
            active workspace. Account records, audit logs, security records,
            billing records, and backup copies may remain for a limited period
            where needed for legal, security, fraud prevention, tax, accounting,
            disaster recovery, or operational purposes. Backup exports are
            created only when you request them.

            extension state such as authentication tokens, dismissed domains,
            and settings needed to operate across job sites. You can control
