## Top 5 Failure Modes by Frequency

- **Parser limitation — zero entries extracted** (17, high): Missed expected experience: Software Developer at Keystone Robotics Personas: career-changer, career-gap, entry-cs-grad, heavy-formatting, mid-engineer, multi-job-pm, senior-ic.
- **AI prompt issue — resume in non-English language** (4, high): Missed expected experience: 后端软件工程师 at 星桥科技 Personas: non-english-mandarin, non-english-spanish.
- **Parser limitation — scanned PDF / OCR not wired** (2, high): Missed expected experience: QA Automation Engineer at Oakline Software Personas: scanned-pdf.

## Per-Persona Narrative

### career-changer

What worked: 0/2 expected experience entries matched.

What did not: Missed expected experience: Software Developer at Keystone Robotics Missed expected experience: Mechanical Design Engineer at Vector Pump Works

Surprising findings: Harness calls extractTextFromFile, smartParseResume, and extractBankEntries directly to mirror upload parsing without writing to the application database. Low confidence parse — resume may be poorly formatted or non-standard No work experience detected No education detected

### career-gap

What worked: 0/3 expected experience entries matched.

What did not: Missed expected experience: Backend Engineer at Prairie Ledger Missed expected experience: Software Engineer at Lakefront Health Tech

Surprising findings: Harness calls extractTextFromFile, smartParseResume, and extractBankEntries directly to mirror upload parsing without writing to the application database. Low confidence parse — resume may be poorly formatted or non-standard No work experience detected No education detected

### entry-cs-grad

What worked: 0/2 expected experience entries matched.

What did not: Missed expected experience: Software Engineering Intern at Northstar Labs Missed expected experience: Data Engineering Intern at CivicByte Studio

Surprising findings: Harness calls extractTextFromFile, smartParseResume, and extractBankEntries directly to mirror upload parsing without writing to the application database. Low confidence parse — resume may be poorly formatted or non-standard No work experience detected No education detected

### heavy-formatting

What worked: 0/2 expected experience entries matched.

What did not: Missed expected experience: Senior Frontend Engineer at Canvas Harbor Missed expected experience: Frontend Engineer at Pixel Foundry

Surprising findings: Harness calls extractTextFromFile, smartParseResume, and extractBankEntries directly to mirror upload parsing without writing to the application database. Low confidence parse — resume may be poorly formatted or non-standard No work experience detected No education detected

### mid-engineer

What worked: 0/2 expected experience entries matched.

What did not: Missed expected experience: Software Engineer II at Brightforge Systems Missed expected experience: Software Engineer at Harbor Metrics
